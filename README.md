# PC Offer Estimator

A web app that calculates offers for used PC components based on specifications like **CPU**, **GPU**, **RAM**, **storage**, **age**, and **condition**. This estimator is designed to give realistic low-end price estimates by factoring in performance scores, age, and wear level.

## Features

- **Component-Based Estimation**: Calculates a offer based on CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage specs.
- **Condition Adjustment**: Multiplies the offer based on the condition (New, Like New, Used, Worn).
- **Age & Wear Modifiers**: Accounts for how old and worn components are to adjust pricing further.
